# Signing

Tinycast is signed with a **stable self-signed identity** called `Tinycast Self-Signed`. Keeping the
_same_ identity on every build is what makes macOS remember the Accessibility permission across
rebuilds and updates — ad-hoc signing changes every build and macOS forgets the grant.

An Apple Developer ID certificate now exists, but nothing is signed with it yet. Why that switch is
staged rather than immediate is [below](#the-developer-id-migration).

You create this identity **once**. The same identity is used for:

- **local dev builds** — so Accessibility persists while you develop (the Xcode project signs with it), and
- **packaged builds** — `Scripts/build-dmg.sh` refuses to run without it.

## 1. Create the `Tinycast Self-Signed` identity (once)

Run these in a terminal. They generate a self-signed code-signing certificate and import it into your
login keychain:

```sh
# Generate a self-signed code-signing cert (10-year, codeSigning use).
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 \
  -keyout /tmp/tc-key.pem -out /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=Tinycast Self-Signed" \
  -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:false" \
  -addext "keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature" \
  -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,codeSigning"

# Bundle it as a .p12 (the non-empty password keeps `security import` happy).
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey /tmp/tc-key.pem -in /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -name "Tinycast Self-Signed" -out /tmp/tc.p12 -passout pass:tinycast

# Import into the login keychain so codesign can use it without prompting.
security import /tmp/tc.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db \
  -P tinycast -A -T /usr/bin/codesign

rm -f /tmp/tc-key.pem /tmp/tc-cert.pem /tmp/tc.p12
```

Verify it's there:

```sh
security find-identity -p codesigning | grep "Tinycast Self-Signed"
```

Now local builds (Xcode, VS Code F5, `xcodebuild`) sign with it, and you grant Accessibility once.

## Hardened runtime

**Release only**, on both targets: `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME: YES`, which notarization requires. Debug
must stay without it — hardened runtime turns on library validation, and Xcode's
`Tinycast Dev.debug.dylib` is refused at launch because a self-signed identity carries no Team ID for
the loader to match. The flag is not part of the designated requirement, so turning it on costs no
Accessibility grant. Each entitlement in `Tinycast/Tinycast.entitlements` earns its place:

| Entitlement | Without it |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` | Every Apple event is refused with `-1743` and no prompt — Get Info and the System Events–driven system actions die silently |
| `com.apple.security.device.camera` | The camera prompt never appears and access resolves as denied |
| `com.apple.security.personal-information.calendars` | `requestFullAccessToEvents()` returns `false` in milliseconds with no dialog, and Tinycast never appears under System Settings › Calendars |

**A usage string is not enough under the hardened runtime.** `tccd` checks the matching entitlement
*before* it prompts, and without it logs "requires entitlement … but it is missing" and denies on the
spot — no dialog, no error, status still `.notDetermined`. A grant saved before the hardened runtime
arrived keeps working, since `tccd` does not re-check it, which is why this surfaces only on fresh
installs. Adding a protected resource therefore means adding its usage string *and* its entitlement.

`RESOURCE_ENTITLEMENTS` in `Scripts/verify-signature.sh` maps every protected resource's usage string
to its entitlement, including resources Tinycast does not use. That grants nothing — only
`Tinycast.entitlements` does, and a row whose usage string `Info.plist` doesn't declare is skipped. It
is there so a future feature that adds the usage string but forgets the entitlement fails the release
instead of shipping a prompt that can never appear.

Nothing else is needed: the only `dlopen` is Apple's own IOBluetooth, so library validation is left
on, and `node`, `ray` and shell commands are separate processes it never reaches. Bluetooth has no
hardened-runtime entitlement.

`./Scripts/verify-signature.sh <path-to-.app>` asserts all of this — the runtime flag on the app *and*
on `Contents/Helpers/ClipboardTextHelper`, an intact nested seal, no `get-task-allow`, and an
entitlement for every usage string `Info.plist` declares. Both release jobs run it before packaging:
a nested binary missing the runtime flag is the most common notarization rejection, and a usage string
missing its entitlement ships a permission that can never be granted.

## The Developer ID migration

**The Developer ID identity stays a release-only fact.** When the switch happens it is named on
`Scripts/build-dmg.sh`'s `xcodebuild` line and nowhere else: `project.yml` keeps signing with
`Tinycast Self-Signed`, so a contributor keeps building with the one they created in §1 — same name,
their own key, never shared. Nothing about local development changes.

## Quarantine (separate from signing)

macOS quarantines anything downloaded from the internet, and Gatekeeper blocks even a correctly
self-signed app with an "unverified developer" warning. A build made on this Mac carries no
quarantine flag; a DMG copied from elsewhere needs it cleared once by hand:
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Tinycast.app"`.
